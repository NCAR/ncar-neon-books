# Container and CESM-Lab Basics

In this tutorial, we are going to learn about container basics, the benefits of using containers, and what CESM-Lab is. 

## Container Basics

CTSM and CESM typically require computing resources that can be
complicated to set up on a personal computer. Now you can easily run
CTSM using a container. 

### What is a container?
A container is preconfigured, portable
application that can reliably run on any computing infrastructure.

### Why use a container?
* **Portable** : Containers can run almost everywhere (Mac, Windows, Linux).
* **Pre-configured** : No installation or porting required on containers.
* **Standardized** : All users get the same environment.

### CESM-Lab
The capability to run NEON tower simulations is available using the CESM-Lab container.

CESM-Lab is a containerized environment with CESM and  Jupyter Lab.

### How do I get started?

The software is available through a Docker
container. This tutorial will guide you through setting up the CTSM
container, where you will find a separate tutorial on running CTSM
at NEON tower sites.

Before diving in, we’ll need to install Docker, which we’ll cover
next.

Some of the instructions also in this tutorial also use basic Linux
commands, which you can run on Macs using the Terminal application
(in the Utilities folder) or a similar application for PCs, like
Windows PowerShell.

Knowledge of Linux is not required for this tutorial. If you are unfamiliar with Linux and would like to know more, there are several tutorials online.
 Software Carpentry is one organization that has accessible [online lessons]( https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/).
